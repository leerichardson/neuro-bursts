- Understand the exact steps Mikael/Pawel used to produce their plots 
	+ Write a new section in Beta-Bursts document that summarizes the procedure
	+ E-mail Pawel to understand which parts of the code correspond to which parts of the procedure. 

- Theory: The "above threshold" method may underestimate the length of a signal drastically, because it doesn't account for the build up. 

- Look into restricting F to be a Fourier Frequency.
	+ This is what RAFA did!
	+ Or, extend to use an over-complete Fourier dictionary: 
		+ Can we extend the FFT to this case? Non-uniform FFT?
		"The most well-known example is the standard Fourier dictionary for which we have the fast Fourier transform algorithm. A typical implementation requires 2 · n storage locations and 4·n·J multiplications if n is dyadic: n = 2J . Hence for very long signals we can apply Φ and ΦT with much less storage and time than the matrices would nominally require. Simple adaptation of this idea leads to an algorithm for over-complete Fourier dictionaries."
