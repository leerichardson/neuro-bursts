# --- Goals ---
- PhD Thesis Chapter 9 on the Beta Bursts Application (March 2019)
- Paper w/ SWDFT application to Bursts (If Desired by Collaborators)

# --- Tasks --- 
- Run simulation studies that demonstrate properties of the procedure 
	+ On the window size estimator 
		- Max vs. Window Size on example signal 
		- Max vs. Window Size on Beta-Bursts signal
		- Simulation: Maximum across varying window sizes. Show that the maximum occurs when the window size equals the signal length.
	+ On the maximum as the correct estimator
		- Simulation: Does not the MAXIMUM, but the LARGEST K Values, better estimate the signal?
	+ On the Multi-taper as the proper estimator 
		- Simulation: Vary the Spectrogram estimator (multitaper, swdft, smoothed, morlet)
	+ On comparing across window sizes
		+ Simulation: Is the normalization across different window sizes fair?
		+ Idea: Use Fisher's concept of the ''proportion'' in each window position. That way, Parsevals relation holds, and we are still in an identical situation. 

- Fit the beta-bursts procedure on the data-set 
	+ Re-Read the MLE materials I previously wrote (DONE)
	+ Add a restriction over F (Fourier Frequencies) (DONE) 
		- Lesson: Still fairly slow. Better to optimize over window sizes
	- Program the optimization over window size on an example trial 

- Write up a polished beta-bursts document 
	+ Add a Figure with a sample burst from the dataset (DONE)
	+ Write first draft of document (DONE)
	+ Polish, re-read, send the finalized document to Bill
	+ Write: Literature Review of Local Harmonic Model 
	+ Write: Literature review of methodology for bursts application 
		- Understand the exact steps Mikael/Pawel used to produce their plots 
			+ E-mail Pawel to understand which parts of the code correspond to which parts of the procedure. 

- Theory: The "above threshold" method may underestimate the length of a signal drastically, because it doesn't account for the build up.
	+ Check if this is true empirically 

- Read, Summarize Local Harmonic Regression Literature 
	+ Irizarry 1998 Additive Sound (DONE)
	+ Irizarry JASA
	+ Irizarry Weighted Time-Series Analysis 
	+ Irizarry Asymptotics 
	+ Irizarry Locally meaningful 
	+ Irizarry Local Likelihood 
	+ Hanaan (3 Papers + Books)
	+ Brown (Correction to Hanaan)
	+ Walker 
	+ Rosenblatt
	+ Convert Directory Notebook into .html webpage

- Look into over-complete dictionaries for F:
	+ Can we extend the FFT to this case? Non-uniform FFT? From Donoho:
	"The most well-known example is the standard Fourier dictionary for which we have the fast Fourier transform algorithm. A typical implementation requires 2 · n storage locations and 4·n·J multiplications if n is dyadic: n = 2J . Hence for very long signals we can apply Φ and ΦT with much less storage and time than the matrices would nominally require. Simple adaptation of this idea leads to an algorithm for over-complete Fourier dictionaries."
